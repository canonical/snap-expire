This repository's CI will daily broadcast snaps branches soon to expire in
Mattermost's ~branch-expirations channel.

As the Snap Store considers that information is private data, to enroll
your snap here, you first need to gather authorization data.

The recipe to enroll your snap is:

* Locally, "snap install surl".
* Locally, snap-expire -e {emailregistered@forthe.snapstore} -a {snap} {snap}
  You will be asked your password and 2FA.
  This causes your authentication identifier file (used in next step) to be
  created.
* Copy the contents of ~/snap/surl/common/snap.surl to a new repository secret
  in https://github.com/canonical/snap-expire/settings/secrets/actions.
* Add your run of snap-expire to .github/workflows/ci.yaml.
* Open a merge request.
