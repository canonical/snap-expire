This repository's CI will daily broadcast snaps branches soon to expire in
Mattermost's ~branch-expirations channel.

As the Snap Store considers that information is private data, to enroll
your snaps here, you first need to gather authorization data.

The recipe to enroll your snaps is:

* Locally, "snap install surl".
* Locally, surl -e {emailregistered@forthe.snapstore} -a {snap} {snap}
  You will be asked your password and 2FA.
  This causes your authentication identifier file (used in next step) to be
  created.
* Copy the contents of ~/snap/surl/common/snap.surl to a new repository secret
  in https://github.com/canonical/snap-expire/settings/secrets/actions.
  This is an one-time operation, if you have more than one snap under your belt 
  you'll use the same identifier file.
* Add your printf line and env line to .github/workflows/ci.yaml.
* Append your entry to watched-snaps.
