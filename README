This repository's CI will daily broadcast snaps branches soon to expire in
Mattermost's ~branch-expirations channel.

As the Snap Store considers that information is private data, to enroll
your snaps here, you first need to gather authorization data.

The recipe to enroll your snaps is:

* Locally, "snap install surl".
* Locally,
  $ surl -e {your@snapstore.email} -p package_access -s production --snap {snap} -a {auth-file}
  You will be asked your password and 2FA.
  This causes your authentication identifier file (used in next step) to be
  created.
  You can provide multiple --snap arguments if you prefer to generate an
  unified authentication identifier file.
* Copy the contents of ~/snap/surl/common/{auth-file}.surl to a new repository
  secret in https://github.com/canonical/snap-expire/settings/secrets/actions.
* Add your printf line and env line to .github/workflows/ci.yaml.
* Append your entry to watched-snaps.
